# js-project-business-site

## Live Demo
[https://kaffekolombia.netlify.app/](https://kaffekolombia.netlify.app/)

First solo project, for the js-project-business-site assignment.
I created a fictitious website for Kaffe Colombia Express, a local café/restaurant/grocery store in my neighborhood.

Implemented pages:
• index.html (Home)
• menu.html (Menu)
• contact.html (Contact form)

The project seems to meet the intended requirements:

The whole site should be responsive and functional across all viewport sizes (320px-1600px)

Navigation and Layout
Responsive navigation bar
Card/article grid system
Combined usage of CSS Grid and Flexbox
Responsive header with hero image/video

Interactive Elements
A form including at least 3 different input types (4 in this case):
Text input
Radio button set
Checkbox set
Submit button

Form configuration: POST method to https://httpbin.org/anything

Responsive hamburger menu:
Visible on mobile devices
Interactive functionality via DOM manipulation

Deployment:
Successful deployment on Netlify

Plus 5 stretch goals:
Added a box shadow to make the cards look like Polaroids
Aligned the cards to the centre of the page
Added some validation to the form.
Made the hamburger more intuitive, by indicating if it’s expanded or collapsed by changing the icon
Added some CSS animations to the project, e.g. a slide-in effect when the hamburger menu expands.

Let me know if you have any suggestions for improvements!
